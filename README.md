# Store Challenge

Welcome to the store-challenge! This repository contains logic to get products from database and consult a list of products with the sku, name, category, price and discounts.

## Versions
I created two versions for this challenge. The reason is because during the first development in reactive way, I feel that I can show more knowledge doing the synchronous way.
- [Reactive way Kotlin and Coroutines](tree/main/store-coroutines-challenge)
- [Sync way Kotlin](tree/main/store-sync-challenge)
